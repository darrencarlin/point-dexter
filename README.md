## Bugs

**Timer Display Issue for Late Joiners**: When a user joins a session during an active timed vote, their timer display incorrectly resets to the full duration instead of showing the remaining time. For example, if a user joins with 10 seconds remaining on a 60-second timer, their display shows 60 seconds. However, the vote correctly ends after the actual 10 seconds.

**Selecting Stories**: You shouldn't be able to select the same story twice (maybe local filtering out selected stories)
